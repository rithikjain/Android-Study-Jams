<h1>Spill the Tea</h1>

<b> Problem Statement: </b>

We all need some place to write down our thoughts, events or ideas that come to your mind daily.
We write a lot of thoughts that come to our mind daily, but we don't have a nice way to classify them and look back later.
<br>
<b> Proposed Solution : </b>

There are a lot of digital solutions for taking notes, but Spill The Tea proposes a solution in which your data stays within your device and can be organised effectively using hashtags and people.
A user can add a new post in which he can mention hashtags and people.  In the explore page the user can see all posts with a particular hashtag or person.
The core functionality of the app is to be able to look back at the people/things(hashtags) which you have mentioned in the posts.
